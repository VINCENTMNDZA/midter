    <h2><center><b><font color="white"> PROBLEM </font></b></center></h2>
    <p><i><center><font color="white"> The earlier view of the global epidemic representing a systematic disadvantage that may equally affect economic activity of any individual, with any socioeconomic status or from any geographic location, was rejected while finding that certain factors may either increase or decrease people's vulnerability to the financial stress related to COVID-19. In China's context, these factors include education, family income, membership in Communist Party, and state-sector employment. Besides health, other important side effects of COVID-19 impacting well-being include forced unemployment, loss of income and social isolation. The on-going coronavirus pandemic has affected unemployment rates for every state, industry, and major demographic group in the United States, as well as globally. While vulnerable workers are both unemployed and underemployed during the COVID-19 era, many disadvantaged communities are disproportionally impacted so. Particularly disadvantaged were already low-wage industry segment workers and those working in retail sectors of the economy as they had a much greater chance of being laid off and a smaller likelihood to coming back to work.<pre>
    </pre>

        Studies have documented devastating impact of unemployment on whole communities, as strong as that on mental health of individuals. A major research question is to what extent does this unemployment crisis vary between communities? Exploring the role of social disadvantage during this crisis should yield research findings that can inform meaningful policy guidance at individual and systemic levels aiming to support and sustain both affected people and entire areas such as direct cash assistance of those identified communities.<pre>
        </pre>
        
        The literature recognizes the complex interrelationship between employment, overall health, and well-being with unemployment impacting all-cause mortality. Regarding the employment impacts, the COVID-19 caused a drop in consumer demand across all industrial sectors resulting in economic recession and massive unemployment where not only hourly workers but salaried professionals lost their jobs 

Some communities can absorb the impact of economic downturns due to more favorable economic and social factors protecting residents from adversity, yet other communities are witnessing the effect of rising unemployment in the time of COVID-19. Further, the link was found between incidence of the virus in the preceding month and employment. One recent study used a county-level analysis finding that counties with higher COVID-19 incidence suffered the greatest declines in jobs, however, various sectors responded differently to the effects of the virus incidence with largest employment declines observed in leisure and hospitality and other services (such as nail salons, beauty salons, barber shops), thus, control of virus transmission is important to avoid further local employment declines. </font></center></i> </p>
        
        <h3><b><center><font color="white"> SOLUTIONS </font></center></b></h3>
        <p><center><i><font color="white"> Recent projections from the World Trade Organization foretell an economic downturn and job losses worse to the ones caused by the global financial crisis in 2008. Moreover, the OECD declared global GDP growth could fall this year to 1.5% – to nearly half compared to the 2.9% rate predicted before the coronavirus outbreak. There’s also a BBC piece that clearly highlights how different economic sectors across different countries are facing a recession.

People all over the world are increasingly doing online shopping, using videoconferencing and other tech tools platforms to stay connected and they are having more time available to surf social media. This means tech and telecom companies are in a privileged position to provide consumers with digital-related solutions that are having a huge demand.<pre>
</pre>

However, as +100 governments all over the world are introducing travel restrictions and even closing borders to try to contain the virus, many economic sectors are being hurt. A report from Deloitte shows that tech and pharma industries are holding on relatively well. However, airline, railway, and road transport areas are being particularly hurt. The same is true for the travel agencies, the hotel industry, providers of leisure experiences like city tours or surf schools in near-shore areas, hairdressers or other small owned businesses.<pre>
</pre>

Central banks in more than 50 countries have cut interest rates to try to strengthen their economies and many governments have already started preparing extraordinary budgets and recovery plans. However, not all businesses will fit the criteria to benefit from this financial aid (often in the form of postponed social security obligations and/or layoff policies) and many will unavoidably close.<pre>
</pre>

The job market of the future will need unique human qualities such as social intelligence, systems thinking, imagination, innovation, creativity, improvisation to solve unexpected problems or empathy. These skills aren’t (at least yet!) ready to get an algorithmic shape.<pre>
</pre>

It will also be hard for robots to understand the complexity of human emotions as a result of one’s unique genetics and life experience and to provide personal and professional guidance. Jobs in which these skills are highly needed are unliked to like be threatened.<pre>
</pre>

At the same time, there is already a human workforce working on creating and programming these very same robots. These are highly-specialized professionals with a deep understanding of areas such as mechanical engineering, code development, sensors implementation, data analysis, blockchain and many more.
